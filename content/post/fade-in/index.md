Hi. Long time.

I used to have a blog here called "A Memorable Fancy," but the last post I made was a couple years ago, and then I did a site redesign and deleted the blog entirely. I would write about film and media, academia, literature, and daily life.

But why did I stop blogging?

I've been asking myself the same question off and on for quite some time. Did I run out of things to say? A little. Or so I thought.

I started a podcast with some friends. And then I started another. But I stopped doing both of those as well.

One of the problems, I think, is a concept I just recently learned, called context collapse. It's not that I ran out of things to say, or I didn't know how to say them, but I no longer knew who I was saying them _to_. My audience (the one in my head, at least) had morphed, and I found I was trying to please to many different groups, at the risk of alienating another. If I wrote in an academic fashion, I'd alienate the non-academics. If I were to casual or frivolous, my colleagues wouldn't take me seriously.

Well, here I am again. Blogging. But this time I don't care so much about my audience. My audience, I think, will be me, and if you happen to like it, then that's cool too.
